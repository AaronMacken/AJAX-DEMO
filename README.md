# AJAX-DEMO
This is a practice example of AJAX using a bitcoin API. When the button is clicked, a new XMLHttpRequest is created
and a get request is sent to the bitcoin API's end point. The span's innerhtml attribute is then changed each time
the button is clicked to reflect the current price of bitcoin.
